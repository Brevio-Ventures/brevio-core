# Listings: what the release does by itself, and the owner's steps

Pushing a version tag `vX.Y.Z` starts `.github/workflows/release.yml`. The package itself contacts no
listing; only the workflow does, after the tests pass.

## What the release workflow does by itself

In this order, each job with only the permissions it needs:

1. **Build.** Runs the tests, builds the package with the toolchain pinned by hash (`scripts/build-requirements.txt`),
   and prepares every file the later jobs publish (`scripts/release_assets.py`): the `brevio-core.pyz` zip
   application, its CycloneDX SBOM, the release notes, `server.json` with the version from `VERSION`, and a copy of the
   skill without its `license:` line.
2. **PyPI**, by trusted publishing, in the `brevio-core-pypi` environment. Waits for its reviewers.
3. **Attestation** of `brevio-core.pyz` (build provenance).
4. **GitHub release** for the tag: the notes are `RELEASE.md`, the release commit and the SHA-256 of the `.pyz`, then
   notes generated from the commits. `brevio-core.pyz`, its attestation bundle and the SBOM are attached.
5. **The major tag** (`v0` until 1.0) moves to the release commit, in the `brevio-core-major-tag` environment. Waits
   for its reviewers.
6. **The MCP registry**, in the `mcp-registry` environment: `mcp-publisher login github-oidc`, then `publish`. No token
   is stored; the workflow's identity proves the `io.github.Brevio-Ventures` namespace. The registry checks the package on PyPI,
   so this runs after it and retries for a few minutes.
7. **The skill registry**, in the `clawhub` environment, when a `CLAWHUB_TOKEN` secret is set there. Without it the job
   says so and does nothing. The registry publishes every skill under the MIT-0 licence, so only the
   `skills/brevio-core` folder goes there, without the `license:` line. The code stays Apache-2.0 here and on PyPI.

To check a downloaded `.pyz`: `gh attestation verify brevio-core.pyz --repo Brevio-Ventures/brevio-core`, and compare its
SHA-256 with the release notes.

## The owner's steps for each release

1. Merge the release pull request.
2. Tag the merge commit `vX.Y.Z` (signed) and push the tag.
3. Approve the `brevio-core-pypi` environment, then the `brevio-core-major-tag` environment.
4. The GitHub Marketplace: open the release, edit it, tick "Publish this Action to the GitHub Marketplace" and save.
   GitHub offers this only on the release page.

## The repository's description and topics

One sentence everywhere: the repository description, the PyPI summary (`description` in `pyproject.toml`), the first
line of the README and the docs site. Paste it into the repository's About box:

```
Catches the mistakes coding agents repeat before they merge: a pull-request gate with no model call and no API key.
```

Website: the docs site, `https://brevio-ventures.github.io/brevio-core`. Topics (the About box takes them one by one; PyPI reads the same words from
`keywords` in `pyproject.toml`):

```
coding-agents agent-mistakes code-review pull-request github-action pre-commit mcp-server agent-hooks static-analysis code-quality
```

## Once

- **Environments.** Create `brevio-core-pypi` and `brevio-core-major-tag` with required reviewers, and `mcp-registry`
  and `clawhub` (reviewers optional). The PyPI trusted publisher names `release.yml` and `brevio-core-pypi`.
- **The skill registry token.** `clawhub login` on your machine, then `clawhub token` prints the token. Store it as the
  secret `CLAWHUB_TOKEN` of the `clawhub` environment.
- **The first Marketplace listing:** as in step 4, plus the categories.
- **The MCP server directory.** Add the repository to the directory, then claim it. `glama.json` at the root of the
  repository is what proves the claim: it names `rmb` as the maintainer, so change that to the claiming
  GitHub username first if it is not right.
## Awesome lists, in launch week

The owner opens each pull request by hand, from their own account; nothing here is automated. Read each list's
contributing rules first: most want one line, in alphabetical order, in the right section, and a repository with a
licence and a README. Each entry below leads with the same sentence as the description.

- **The awesome list of MCP servers**, under "Developer Tools", in alphabetical order:

  ```
  - [Brevio-Ventures/brevio-core](https://github.com/Brevio-Ventures/brevio-core) 🐍 🏠 - Catches the mistakes coding agents repeat before they merge: scan files or a diff, read a rule page, compile a fixed bug into a local guard. No model call; `scan`, the agent hook and the MCP server use no network and send nothing.
  ```

  Pull request title: `Add brevio-core (developer tools)`. Body:

  ```
  Adds brevio-core, in Developer Tools. It is a local MCP server over stdio (Python, standard library only) with
  four tools: scan, explain, list_rules and learn. It makes no model call and needs no API key. Licence: Apache-2.0.
  I maintain it.
  ```

- **The awesome list for Claude Code**, under "Hooks" (or "Tooling" when the list has no hooks section):

  ```
  - [brevio-core](https://github.com/Brevio-Ventures/brevio-core) - Catches the mistakes coding agents repeat before they merge. A PostToolUse and Stop hook scans each edit and hands the findings back to the agent; the same rules run as a pull-request check. No model call, no API key.
  ```

  Pull request title: `Add brevio-core (hooks)`. Body:

  ```
  Adds brevio-core, a hook that scans each file the agent edits against fixed rules for the mistakes coding agents
  repeat, and returns the findings with decision: block so the agent fixes them in the same turn. An agent cannot
  silence it: the hook never honours an ignore comment. Set up with `brevio-core init --with hook`. Apache-2.0;
  I maintain it.
  ```

- **The awesome list of Cursor rules and hooks**, under "Hooks" or "Tools":

  ```
  - [brevio-core](https://github.com/Brevio-Ventures/brevio-core) - Catches the mistakes coding agents repeat before they merge: a postToolUse and stop hook plus a rule file, and the same rules as a pull-request check.
  ```

- **The awesome list of agent skills**, under "Code quality" or "Developer tools":

  ```
  - [brevio-core](https://github.com/Brevio-Ventures/brevio-core/tree/main/skills/brevio-core) - Catches the mistakes coding agents repeat before they merge: tells the agent when to scan its changes and how to read a finding.
  ```

Same body as above, adjusted to the list. Do not ask anyone for a star, and do not open the same pull request twice.

## Later, once there is traction

- The pre-commit hook list.
- The awesome lists of GitHub Actions and of static analysis tools, with the Action and the rule pages.
