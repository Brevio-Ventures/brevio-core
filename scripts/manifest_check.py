"""Fail a pull request that changes a file the release does not export (CONTRIBUTING.md, "How this repo works").

This repository is an export of a private harness. Each release replaces every file listed in ``MANIFEST.json``, and
a merged change is brought back into the harness through that list. A file outside it has no way back, so a change to
it would be lost at the next release. The files the release writes itself (``RELEASE_ONLY``) are never edited in a
pull request. ``ALLOWED`` lists the few paths that belong to this repository alone.

The manifest is read from the base commit, so a pull request cannot widen it. Before the first release there is no
manifest and nothing is checked. Standard library only.
