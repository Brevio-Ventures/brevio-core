"""Rule IDs are permanent (ROADMAP E33, the 0.6 set, 2026-11-05).

``rule_ids.json`` beside this file records each rule ID of the last release with its catalogue line (its title) and its
status. Against it, an ID may never disappear (a retired rule stays in the catalogue as ``deprecated``), never come back
with another title (that would be a new rule under an old ID), and never leave ``deprecated``; a rule the file does not
hold yet must ship as ``preview``. The release notes list what was added, changed and retired since that file. After a
release, record the new IDs with ``--write`` and commit the file. Standard library only, so it exports with the rules.

    python -m brevio.pipeline.code_rules.stability --check   list a removed, reused or revived ID
    python -m brevio.pipeline.code_rules.stability --write   record the current IDs (after a release)
